# Telemetry

Power Apps offers functionality to monitor the execution of an app at runtime. You can use the [monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/monitor-overview) to debug or investigate performance of the Provision Assist app if required. 

The Activity monitor tracks the following actions: 

- Click event.
- Data refresh.
- Duration of an event.
- Data source of every event along with event name.
- UI Control on which operation is performed.

There is also the ability to integrate Power Apps with Azure Application Insights - this functionality is coming to this solution at a later date - see the backlog.
